saveOrUpdate behaviour/functionality changes as per identifier generation logic
1) if generated identifier:  if primary key value is set will go for update
				if primary key value is not set will go for inset


			Account acc = new Account();
			acc.setId(13);
			acc.setName("Grish");
			acc.setBalance(500000);
			tx = session.beginTransaction();
			
			session.saveOrUpdate(acc);

			here primary key is @GeneratedValue so here we have set id it will go directly for update.




2) if assigned identifier
			if you have set primary key it will first check whetehr that primary key record exists by firing select query first, if present record fire update else insert

Account acc = new Account();
			acc.setId(13);
			acc.setName("Grish");
			acc.setBalance(500000);

Hibernate: select account_.acc_id, account_.balance as balance2_0_, account_.isActive as isactive3_0_, account_.name as name4_0_ from account_tbl account_ where account_.acc_id=?
Hibernate: insert into account_tbl (balance, isActive, name, acc_id) values (?, ?, ?, ?)
